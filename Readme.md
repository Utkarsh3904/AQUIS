## Architecture

```
back-end/          Node.js + Express API server
front-end/         Next.js 16 frontend
ml/                Python ML module: pooled XGBoost pipeline + Streamlit analysis dashboard
docs/              Documentation
```

**Data flow:**
NWDP Telemetry API + Assessment Excel files → PostgreSQL → Statistical Analysis + ML → Express APIs → Frontend

The **ML module (`ml/`)** is the forecasting/analytics engine. It consumes a cleaned 6-hourly telemetry archive, trains one **pooled (global) XGBoost** model over 600 Uttar Pradesh groundwater stations, calibrates q05/q50/q95 quantile forecasts into 90% prediction intervals, scans the whole fleet for 30-day moves, and exposes a **4-page Streamlit dashboard** (`ml/app.py`, port 8501).

The forecast surface is a dedicated **trajectory v2** engine (`ml/_trajectory.py`): a genuine **120-step, 6-hourly, 30-day** forecast per station (no interpolation — one real model output per 6 h step), with per-horizon q05/q50/q95 and an **evidence-based confidence label** (HIGH / DIRECTIONAL / LOW). Drivers ahead of the anchor are legitimate forecasts — **Open-Meteo** weather (days 1–16) with climatology beyond, and **CWC 3-day river forecasts** where the district is covered. The Forecast page renders this as a single dark-theme dashboard card (bright q05/q95 band, no dot markers).

A **near-real-time refresh daemon** (`ml/refresh/`) keeps forecast surfaces current: it runs fetch → align → inference → publish on a fixed 6-hourly wall-clock grid (01:00 / 07:00 / 13:00 / 19:00 IST), writes per-station forecasts + `meta.json`, and scores realised readings (verification + drift gating).

> A headless **Flask HTTP API** (`ml/api.py`) runs alongside the Streamlit dashboard —
> root `/` lists endpoints, `/health`, `/stations`, `/forecast/<slug>`, `/assistant/chat`.
> The Node gateway can proxy it via `ML_SERVICE_URL` (`http://localhost:5000`).

## Scope & data coverage

**Uttar Pradesh groundwater monitoring is mostly *manual*, not real-time.** This is the single most important constraint on what AQUIS can forecast.

- UP has ~**75 districts**, and groundwater there is monitored through two separate networks on the National Water Data Portal (NWDP/NWIC):
  - **Manual** — measured a few times a year by field staff (CGWB ~1,000 UP wells, 4×/yr; UPGW publishes its own *"Ground Water Level (Manual - Quarterly)"* dataset, 1991–2020).
  - **Telemetry** — automated 6-hourly Digital Water Level Recorders, a *narrow, recently-deployed slice* of the network.
- **AQUIS only ingests the telemetry feed** (`GWL Telemetry 6-Hourly, UPGW`). That feed wires just **1,353 stations across 34 of UP's ~75 districts**. Districts without telemetry gauges never appear in the archive — verified: NWIC probes return `total=0` for e.g. Allahabad/Prayagraj, Amethi, Amroha, Sambhal, G.B. Nagar even with rename aliases (`ml/data/raw/nwic.py`).
- Therefore, in this repo: **1,353 stations / 34 districts = "everything the telemetry archive has"**, and **600 stations / 29 districts = "the ones still alive in 2026"** (selected by `01_select.py`, ≥8 of 9 Jan–Sep 2026 months with a reading). Neither number is a scope preference — the data decides.
- **Project vs ML scope:** the backend ingests NWDP telemetry countrywide (~7.4M records) + CGWB assessment Excels; the **forecasting** scope is **UP-GWL telemetry only**. A station without a live 2026 telemetry stream is simply not forecast-able by this pipeline.
- More detail + the source links (UPGW portal, CGWB monitoring-station page, CGWB high-frequency-data guidelines, UP GW Year Book) live in **`ml/MODEL_CARD.md`**.

## Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Python 3.11+ (venv/packages below tested on 3.14)

### 2. Backend
```bash
cd back-end
cp .env.example .env        # Edit with your database credentials
npm install
npm run migrate             # Apply schema
npm run import-assessments  # Import assessment Excel files
npm run import-telemetry    # Import NWDP telemetry data (large dataset)
npm start                   # Start API at http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. ML dashboard
```bash
cd ml
venv/bin/streamlit run app.py     # http://localhost:8501
```
The ML venv lives at `ml/venv` (Python 3.14). Use `ml/venv/bin/python` for all pipelines below.

> The optional **AI assistant** page needs **Ollama**: install `ollama`, then `ollama pull llama3.2:3b` and ensure `ollama serve` is running. The instant-facts panel works even when Ollama is down.

### 4. Frontend
```bash
cd front-end
npm install
npm run dev                 # Start Next.js at http://localhost:3000
```
> Note: Express runs on `:3000`; if both run, pick a different port for one of them.

### Data
- **Archive:** `data/processed/common.parquet` — the cleaned 6-hourly telemetry source of truth: **~5.3M records / 1,353 UP stations, 2021-01-01 → 2026-09-05**. Every pipeline step reads it read-only.
- **Refresh:** `13_refresh_nwic.py` pulls *newer-than-current-max* rows per district from the live NWIC 2026 resource, merges (deduped, chronological, dtype-coerced) back into the archive, and can retrain (`--retrain`) or run the staging check / swap (`--deploy-check`, `--deploy-install`). Run it **manually**:
  ```bash
  cd ml
  venv/bin/python -u 13_refresh_nwic.py --dry-run       # report new rows
  venv/bin/python -u 13_refresh_nwic.py --retrain       # merge + rerun pipeline to the trained model
  venv/bin/python 13_refresh_nwic.py --deploy-check     # is the loaded build 2026-current?
  ```
- **Cleaning:** telemetry sentinels and `|GWL|>100 m` spikes dropped; per-station 0.5–99.5% quantile trim; stations with a >15 m annual-median regime shift (datum errors) excluded; features are causal (lags only).

### Model
One **pooled** model, not one per station:
- **Grid + horizon:** 6-hourly track, single **30-day** horizon (`GWL(t+120) − GWL(t)`, delta target). Today's level is the anchor feature — never predicted.
- **XGBoost:** `reg:squarederror`, early stopping on the Oct–Dec 2025 validation split; train sampled 1 slot/day for memory.
- **Ridge** (linear baseline), **persistence** (0-change), and per-station **day-of-year climatology** are benchmarked in `07_evaluate.py`.
- **Quantile uncertainty** (`11_quantile.py`): native `reg:quantileerror` q05/q50/q95 pooled forecasters, empirically calibrated on non-overlapping windows → `quantile_calibration.json` (stride coverage 0.908 ≥ 0.80 target, so `k = 1.0`; median band ±~1.03 m).

### Trajectory v2 (`_trajectory.py`) — the Forecast page model
A separate **direct multi-horizon shared XGBoost** on the 6 h grid: horizon `h ∈ 1..120` is an input feature, each step is a genuine model output (no recursion, no interpolation). Full spec + results: **[`docs/ml-trajectory-v2-spec.md`](docs/ml-trajectory-v2-spec.md)**.

- **Forward drivers (forecasts, never future observations):** Open-Meteo weather → days 1–16 (past-window features only); beyond 16 d the backend falls back to climatology; CWC 3-day river forecasts bridge the near horizon where the district is covered. A missing driver **downgrades** confidence at those horizons.
- **Honest 2026 backtest (full fleet, 73,881 non-overlap windows):** 30-day RMSE **trajectory 2.106 m < production direct-30d 2.132 m < persistence 2.151 m** → trajectory **promoted** (`promote_trajectory = True`). Calibrated to **90% coverage at every horizon** (widening `s ∈ [0.80, 1.28]`).
- **Confidence framework:** per-point label from **weighted evidence** (interval quality, vs-persistence, direction, width, station integrity, driver availability, anchor OOD, stability) — not interval width alone. Anchor = latest observed reading, never predicted; `q05 ≤ q50 ≤ q95` at every step.
- **Forecast page:** single dark-theme card — one "Forecast starts" boundary, observed tail, q50 + a bright q05/q95 band (no dot markers), 6 metric cards (+24h/+7d/+30d/change/confidence), direction banner. The card intentionally references only the trajectory forecast.

### Head-to-head (30-day, 2026 held-out, 6h grid)
| Model | Level RMSE (m) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **XGBoost (pooled)** | **2.242** | beats persistence +2.1% raw |
| persistence | 2.290 | |
| Ridge | 2.456 | |
| climatology | 3.572 | |

**Honest scale of evidence** (overlap-aware, non-trivial): because 6-hourly 30-day windows overlap ~99%, the trustworthy campaign is the **stride** set — **2.339 m vs persistence 2.382 m (+1.8%)** on 3,371 independent windows; effective sample ≈ 6,600 rows (lag-1 ACF 0.86). **Spatial CV** (leave-block-out station retraining) = 1.97 m mean / 1.82 m median — the 2026 temporal holdout, not spatial leakage, is the binding constraint. Feature ablation: rain/weather/calendar add ~+0.03–0.05 m when dropped; river/canal and GWL lags are neutral at 30 d given the anchor.

### Verify after editing
```bash
cd ml
venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests    # 151-unit test suite (AppTest gated via AQUIS_APPTEST=1)
venv/bin/python gate_check.py                    # baseline checks (frozen RMSE/CV/coverage/eff-N/ACF + trajectory; latest: GATE PASS 10/10)
```

### Dashboard (`app.py`, Streamlit, 4 active pages)
**Assistant** (station-pinned LLM, default page) · Correlation (mode/metric pickers + recharge-lag curve) ·
**Forecast (single dark-theme trajectory v2 card: 120 genuine 6-hourly points, bright q05/q95 band, confidence, direction)** ·
Sources (manifest quality, association method, soil/LULC status). Legacy pages (Overview, Drivers, Stations, Model, Fleet) were removed from `app_pages/`; Verification (`app_pages/verification.py`) can be wired in when wanted.

## API Reference (backend → app)

Full backend/ML endpoint reference lives in **[`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md)**. Summary:

- **Node `:3000`** endpoints: stations, telemetry, assessments (CGWB), trends (Mann-Kendall + Sen's slope), ml-data, data-quality, ingestion.
- **ML Flask `:5000` (`ml/api.py`, live, v3.1.0)** — JSON endpoints: root `/` (lists available routes), `/health`, `/stations` (with district/q filtering, lat/lon per station), `/stations/<slug>` (per-station facts, no LLM), `/stations/<slug>/series` (6-hourly GWL + driver points for relation charts), `/forecast/<slug>` (trajectory v2), `/assistant/chat` (Ollama-backed LLM). CORS enabled; the Node gateway can proxy via `ML_SERVICE_URL`.

---

## Testing
```bash
cd back-end
npm test
```
Backend tests cover classification, statistics, telemetry utilities, ML gateway, and app configuration.

ML validation: stdlib `unittest` suite in `ml/tests/` (151 data-gated tests, no pytest; the full Forecast-page AppTest is gated behind `AQUIS_APPTEST=1` because the trajectory engine is slow) + `ml/gate_check.py` regression gate.

## Key Data Facts

- NWDP telemetry: ~7.4M records across India (backend scope); ML archive = **5.3M records / 1,353 UP stations, 6-hourly, 2021-01-01 → 2026-09-05**; **600 stations / 29 districts** quality in as pooled-model anchors. *(Coverage is telemetry-limited — UP GW monitoring is mostly manual/quarterly; see [Scope & data coverage](#scope--data-coverage).)*
- Assessment years: 2016-2017 … 2025-2026 · 154-column CentralReport Excel (3-level merged headers).
- CGWB classification: Safe (<70%) / Semi-Critical (70–90%) / Critical (90–100%) / Over-Exploited (>100%).
- Forecast uncertainty: **calibrated 90% interval** (q05/q95, `k=1.0`), median half-width ≈1.03 m; 30-day outlooks are **directional**, not exact.
- Forecast surface: the Forecast page shows the **trajectory v2** forecast — **120 genuine 6-hourly steps to +30 d** per station (30-day RMSE 2.106 m, beats both the direct benchmark 2.132 m and persistence 2.151 m on the honest non-overlap 2026 set; calibrated to 90% coverage per horizon). Every point carries an evidence-based confidence label; drivers are Open-Meteo (days 1–16) + CWC river forecasts where available.
- Assistant: Ollama `llama3.2:3b`, station-pinned, grounded in the same data the model consumes.
- Fleet (Sep 2026 scan): **502 stations scored** — median Δ **+0.32 m**, decline 0, recovering 259 at ±0.3 m; no station clears its 90% band (post-monsoon recovery).
